# Sigma Males

A sigma male is a man within the socio sexual hierarchy who chooses to live his life outside of the normal social dominance hierarchy structures of society. Sigma males share many traits in common with the alpha archetype, though their tendency to walk outside of the lines of traditional social dominance hierarchies sets them apart and makes them different. 

The archetypal sigma male is defined above all else by his tendency to forsake the traditional social dominance hierarchies of modern society. 

These men walk a more solitary path. They’re sometimes called ‘lone wolves’ or ‘wanderers.’ 

The socio sexual hierarchy, originally attributed to Vox Day, is a system for describing how men and boys relate to one another and organize themselves into different archetypes. 

These archetypes categorize men based on who they are, how they behave, what their inclinations are likely to be, and how they’re perceived by women in the sexual marketplace. 

I’ve found that the term is often used in conjunction with MGTOW philosophy (men going their own way). Men who believe in the MGTOW movement tend to identify strongly with the sigma archetype. 

They see the idea of walking away from social dominance hierarchies and becoming a lone wolf as synonymous with the MGTOW mandate of walking away from both women and a society which has been quote “destroyed by feminism” end quote (I didn’t say it—that’s just one perspective).

But despite the obvious ideological link between the sigma male archetype and MGTOW, that’s not the only filter through which to view the true identity of the sigma male. 

To get a truly accurate view of exactly how a sigma fits into the modern socio sexual hierarchy, we need to pull the lens back and take a larger look at how the different male archetypes fit together.
