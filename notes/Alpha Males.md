An alpha male is a man who is highly intelligent, confident, and successful. Alpha males are generally considered great leaders and prefer to be in positions of power. Common traits alpha males possess include:

Being in a position of power
Being comfortable with high levels of responsibility
Liking to call the shots
Being the most powerful, impressive, or successful person in the room
Ability to draw people to them and have high levels of influence
An alpha male mindset is being confident and comfortable with yourself, having self-control, and staying in the moment, knowing you can handle anything.

In 1000 BCE, the Greeks created their alphabet, with the first letter being alpha. In the centuries that followed, the most dominant creature in a pack of wild animals (or supposedly more evolved humans) was alpha too.
